title: A (fairly) extensive list of contribution types on Drupal.org
---

<em><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2649100">Contribut to this big long list on Drupal.org</a></em>

This is an extensive list of contribution types that we either track or could track. It should be noted that this is not comprehensive. There are forms of contribution that do not leave behind data that cannot be collected. That said, this list does cover lots of types of contribution and not just code.

If we were to apply some math to this data, we could calculate an engagement score for users and organizations. Tracking engagement over time could be a key health metric.

Many of these contribution types would make profiles and organization pages more robust and would be less subjective than self-reported information.

|Contribution Type|User|Org|Status|Notes|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|

|Documentation revisions||X|Displayed on profile|We show this listed as an aggregate. (i.e. "more than 100 document edits") Cannot credit to orgs|
|Documentation section maintained|X||Not yet tracked|This will be possible with new documentation tools defined in the content strategy.|
|Forum posts created|X||Not displayed|Technically, you can see these as posts by the user, but it is not a total and not limited to forum posts.|

|Membership status|X|X|Displayed on profile|Individual or organization membership|
|Donations and support to the Drupal Association|X|X|Not tracked|We have totals of money spent with the Drupal Association, but we'd need to aggregate this information and likely abstract it to levels.|
|Jobs posted|X|X|Not displayed|Technically, we could show this for users, but I'm not sure there is value.|
|Issues created||X|Displayed|Kinda. This is really "posts" of all types on the user profile.|

|Issues followed|X||Not displayed|This seems like an excellent engagement metric.|
|Projects followed|X||Not displayed|Also an excellent engagement metric.|
|User/interest groups owned/maintained|X||Not displayed|From Groups.drupal.org data|
|User/interest group membership|X||Not displayed|From Groups.drupal.org data|
|User/interest group participation||X|No displayed|By count of nodes created or comments posted|
|Local user groups sponsored||X|Not tracked|Great organization metric|
|Camps sponsored||X|Not tracked|Camps would need to help us track this and submit their data to staff for upload.|

|BoF sessions submitted||X|Not displayed|We have this data for quite a few past DrupalCons.|
|Translations strings submitted|X||Not displayed|From localize.drupal.org. It would be great to figure out how to attribute this work back to organizations for organization credit.|
|Translations strings accepted|X||Not displayed|From localize.drupal.org. It would be great to figure out how to attribute this work back to organizations for organization credit.|
|Translations strings reviewed|X||Not displayed|From localize.drupal.org. It would be great to figure out how to attribute this work back to organizations for organization credit.|

|Case studies submitted|X|X|Displayed|Partially displayed. This shows up on the marketplace listings, but not on the profile.|
|Employees on Drupal.org||X|Displayed on profile|This display could use some work. Acquia's page takes about 10 seconds to load because the list of users is so long.|
|Drupal Planet Posts|X|X|Not tracked|This could be tied back to users with a little customization|
|Camps organized|X||Not tracked|We might be able to pull this from the groups data with some modifications to the roles/management types.|
|User/interest groups organized|X||Not tracked|We might be able to pull this from the groups data going forward|

|Is board member|X||Not tracked|We could put this on profiles|
|Core maintainer|X|X|Not tracked|Orgs it could be "hires a core maintain"|

|Elevated role on Drupal.org|X||Not displayed|We've given special privileges to these people. It would be nice to highlight that.|
|Working group member|X||Not tracked|This would help people understand governance roles a bit better.|
|Security team member|X||Not tracked|We list all of these users, but it would be nice to show it as a badge on their profile pic for interactions in the issue queues.|
|DrupalCon volunteer|X||Not tracked|We have the data in spreadsheets and thank you notes. It really should show up on profiles.|
|DrupalCon attendee|X|X|Not displayed|Technically, people self-report this information right now, which means it is not accurate. Org would be a little difficult to track on this one, but it could possibly be done||
|Global Training Days organizer|X|X|Not tracked|We'd have to import this data.|
|IRC support|X||Not tracked|This would require people to give credit to people with IRC handles listed on Drupal.org. Maybe we could use the Karma points from IRC.|
